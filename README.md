With the phonenumber-normalizer library, you can normalize phone numbers to the E164 format and national format, taking into account the specific complexities of the German number plan. The library can also differentiate between short numbers and those with NDCs and NACs, and can be useful for handling phone numbers in fixed-line contexts.

While Google's [LibPhoneNumber](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber) is a general-purpose library for handling phone numbers worldwide, phonenumber-normalizer a wrapper around it, which is specifically tailored to handle the complexities of the German number plan. Especially, phonenumber-normalizer can differentiate between short numbers and those with NDCs and NACs. When LibPhoneNumber is not able to make this distinction, our wrapping corrects the result.

## Problem Statement(s)

If you have to deal with the complexity of telephone numbers your natural choice of handling it, should be the great [LibPhoneNumber](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber) of [Google](https://opensource.google).

That's what we did for some projects.
And when we found bugs, we [returned that as feedback](./REPORTED_ISSUES.md) in good open-source tradition.
But while some have been accepted and improved that library, other have been long discussed and finally rejected.

We are thankful for Googles work and are not here to blame them for any decision in those discussions, but for providing a technical solution for some inaccuracies which are not (yet) in their center of interest.

### German Number Plan and Its Implementation in Fixed-line

Germany is using a subscriber number (SN) of variable length.
The shortest one known is just 2 digit long, and it goes up to 8 digits.
Within the same area you can call those numbers directly.
If you want to call those numbers from a different area (or another country) you would need the national destination code (NDC) a.k.a. area code or ONKZ. 

From inside Germany you indicate the NDC with the National Access Code (NAC) "0".
From outside Germany you directly start with the NDC after the Country Calling Code (CC) for Germany (49).

Therefore, a local SN could be shorter than a minimal global short number with 3 digits (like Emergency 112) and longer than a maximum short number of 6 digits (like Central contact point for blocking electronic authorizations 116116).
A short number is a service number valid in all areas usable without NAC.
But additionally some short numbers can be called with NAC to reach the Service for a specific area, too - while other service numbers are must not be called with NAC.
From the number plan some short numbers might be called with the CC without NAC, but those routing is (if at all) only implemented when calling from outside Germany, not from within even if you should be able to use German CC starting numbers, too.

The problem we are facing is, identifying/separating:
a) a short number
b) a SN without NDC
c) a SN with NDC and NAC
d) a SN with NDC and CC (but without NAC in Germany but with in Italy)

We need that differentiation upfront normalization to E164 (which is d).
Currently, LibPhoneNumber does not identify this situation and adds the CC infront a number b-style, which represents a complete different phone line.

### Example of failing normalization

The number 20355555 itself is a valid number in many areas and can be dialed if you are within those areas.
If you are outside you need to add the area code with area exit code like 030 for Berlin so for Berlin the number would end up 03020355555. 
But the library does not identify this situation.
A not short number is stored internally with a leading zero and is normalized with the country code.

So 20355555 [will be normalized](https://libphonenumber.appspot.com/phonenumberparser?number=20355555&country=DE) as +4920355555 (E164) or 020355555 (national format) and that is not the same.
This means an NDC of 203 for Duisburg and the SN 55555 - also valid from historical reasons!

It even comes down to very small numbers like 203333 which would not be valid if interpreted as 0203333 because 333 would be too short for that area, but it would be [treated like this](https://libphonenumber.appspot.com/phonenumberparser?number=203333&country=DE).

We need to differentiate the real number entered with or without area code and not just assuming, non short numbers will include those because in mobile context it is so.

Additionally, we want to normalize a number with a default NDC, because we might know where the device - using that number - is located and which NDC is implicitly used.

### Root Cause

We think the problem arises from the following situation:
- LibPhoneNumber is storing the National Significant Number (NSN) as the number, which is the combination of NDC + SN.
- LibPhoneNumber is storing the number as uint64 which does not allow to store (a) leading Zero(s)
- LibPhoneNumber is storing leading Zeros in hasNumberOfLeadingZeros and getNumberOfLeadingZeros
- LibPhoneNumber checks "IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY" only by comparing the length of a number, which might work in a fix length number plan like the North American Number plan, but not with variable number length and optional NDC as in Germany.

What needs to be done:
- Checking if the Country is supporting optional NDC
- Checking if the number is starting with NAC
  - Is the NAC Zero, needs to check hasNumberOfLeadingZeros etc.
  - otherwise need to check prefix of number itself
- if that all applies, such an input needs to be treated as a short number and not be changed for E164 or National format (see short number [normalization of 116116](https://libphonenumber.appspot.com/phonenumberparser?number=116116&country=DE))

The problem has been addressed but rejected like with [issue tracker 180311606](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/180311606).
Reasons are either LibPhoneNumber just make best efforts for formatting and not format checking or that they focus on mobile context while most problems happens in fixed-line context.

## State of Our Implementation

### Code

As a wrapper we did not change any code of LibPhoneNumber itself, so an [upgrade to the newest version should be possible by just updating the version in the dependency POM definition](UPDATE_FOR_NEW_PHONELIB.md).

You could either take the sourcecode directly from the repository or use Maven dependency management by adding:
```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>de.telekom.phonenumber</groupId>
      <artifactId>normalizer</artifactId>
    </dependency>
```
to your POM.

### How to Use

For normalizing a phone number you should just use our PhoneNumberNormalizer either bei Dependency injection or directly with its implementation like:
```
String number = "20355555";
String normalizedNumber = new PhoneNumberNormalizerImpl().normalizePhoneNumber(number, "DE");
// normalizedNumber -> "20355555"
```
So here the number without NAC does not get E164 format, because it is only valid locally.

If we know the context of the devices use (where and how it is used), you can create a DeviceContext:

```
// Device is used on a fixed-line access in Berlin (NDC for Berlin "30" and CC for Germany "49")
DeviceContextDto deviceContext = new DeviceContextDto(DeviceContextLineType.FIXEDLINE, "49", "30");

String number = "20355555";
String normalizedNumber = new PhoneNumberNormalizerImpl().normalizePhoneNumber(number, deviceContext);
// normalizedNumber -> "+493020355555"
```

Now we get a E164 formatted number, because now we know, how which NDC has to be added after the CC.

### Use Of Reflection

To check if a number plan of a country is using an optional NDC and NAC, we need to get the countries region metadata from LibPhoneNumber.

With getMetadataForRegion there is a method on the PhoneNumberUtil class, but it is not public.

So we are forced to [use reflection and override its accessibility](https://github.com/telekom/phonenumber-normalizer/blob/main/src/main/java/de/telekom/phonenumbernormalizer/numberplans/PhoneLibWrapper.java#L280).

If you are using AOT (ahead of time) compiler, you need to take care of this.
(While it is used indirectly with the normal LibPhoneNumber use of the wrapper, it might not be safe for all AOT compilers).

### Use of Own ShortNumber Recognition

When we started with the wrapper, LibPhoneNumber did not recognize some phone assistant services as short numbers.
This as been fixed by [issue tracker 182490059](https://issuetracker.google.com/u/1/issues/182490059). 

But for the EU Social Service Number Range 116xxx, LibPhoneNumber is only checking the assigned number 116116 in Germany.
This is in contradiction to normal validation, where the range is checked and assignment checks are explicitly not in scope.
But for the [issue 183669955](https://issuetracker.google.com/u/1/issues/183669955), they insist on assignment, since they need it for free call checks.
But for other EU states LibPhoneNumber is using the full raneg (e.g. [CZ](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber/blob/4c532d93587d2f9d16dc7a536df55bf179158210/resources/ShortNumberMetadata.xml#L3342))

### One More Thing: Area Gecode Label

There is a table of names for the area code from the BNetzA, which is using non-common abbreviations, which wouldn't be understood by end users.
But LibPhoneNumber is using those and refusing the long transcription, because they only trust the BNetzA document (see [issue tracker 183383466](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/183383466)).
In addition, the BNetzA has published a [document on the ITU](https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/02/02/T02020000510006PDFE.pdf) and [its own website](https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Sachgebiete/Telekommunikation/Unternehmen_Institutionen/Nummerierung/Rufnummern/ONRufnr/Vorwahlverzeichnis_ONB.zip.zip?__blob=publicationFile&v=298), which differ for some values, too.

We provide resolution for each country but also for cities in Germany and states in the US.
Our engine is using easy to generate [JSON data](./src/main/resources/arealabels/nationallabels/), so you could also provide your own resolution.

We only rely on the number analysis / formation logic of LibPhoneNumber.
Their GeoCoder is not used for your labeling.
We only use the LibPhoneNumber's GeoCoder in some testcases, to check if ours and their labeling against each other. 

```
String normalizedNumber = "+493020355555";
Optional<String> label = new PhoneNumberAreaLabelImpl().getLocationByE164Number(normalizedNumber);
// label -> "Berlin"
```
