/**
 * Wrapper around Google's LibPhoneNumber enum {@link ValidationResult} from Google
 * <p>
 * When Google's LibPhoneNumber is validating a phone number it returns a value of the enum {@link ValidationResult}.
 * </p><p>
 * It differentiates two possible positive and five possible negative results. The value
 * {@link ValidationResult#INVALID_LENGTH} is for any negative case, which is not explicitly covered by any of the other
 * four values.
 * While most of the values for negative cases are focused on the number length, the value
 * {@link ValidationResult#INVALID_COUNTRY_CODE} explicitly focuses on a specific number part - the Country Code.
 * </p><p>
 *  This wrapper introduces explicit INVALID_ reason codes for currently undifferentiated number parts IDP, NAC and NDC.
 *  Lastly there is also {@link PhoneNumberValidationResult#INVALID_DRAMA_NUMBER} reason code for the whole number if it
 *  is reserved as a fictional number in arts.
 *  </p><p>
 *  Furthermore it introduces additional IS_POSSIBLE_ values, to hint for more specific calling restrictions of the
 *  validated number besides {@link PhoneNumberValidationResult#IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY}.
